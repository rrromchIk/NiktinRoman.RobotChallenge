## About
This project challenges you to create an algorithm that controls robots' movements, resource collection, and robot creation on a grid. The competition involves multiple participants, and your score depends on the number of resources your robots collect in 50 rounds.

## Game Rules
- The game is played onovided with 10 robots initially.
- Robots can move, collect resources, and create new robots.
- Robot movements consume energy based on the square of the distance traveled.
- Robots collect energy from charging stations.
- Robots can push other ra 100x100 grid.
- Each participant is probots if they share a cell.
- Creating new robots requires energy.
- Game rounds are limited to 50.
- Robots can't move outside the grid.
- The goal is to maximize resource collection within 50 rounds.

## Algorithm Details
Describe your algorithm's logic and strategy. Explain how your algorithm makes decisions about robot movements, resource collection, and creating new robots. Detail any unique features or strategies that set your algorithm apart.
